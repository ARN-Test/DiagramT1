####Some Additional Details :

      * in DFD : 
      
            * There must be a process between dataflow
            * There must be an input and output for  a datastore
      * in USE CASE :
      
            * Consider subsystem by subsystem
      * in Collaboration :
      
            * There must be one control class
            * Careful call of functions
      * in Class :
      
            * Best Approach for collaboraion diagram by collaboration diagram
            * Control class generalization should be avoided [maybe also boundary class]
